                        this could cause massive work delays because the response time for requests for information 
                        (RFI’s) for that contractor was extending to over 120 days and needed to be addressed ASAP.

                        “I used that information to correlate response times on queries with time delays on site. 
                        Before we could do fancy spread sheets and know something wasn’t right, but it was difficult 
                        and time consuming to drill down. Now, because of the integrations and analytics it is all
